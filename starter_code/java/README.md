# Java Skeleton for Low Latency Challenge

This repository contains a skeleton for reading, scoring, and writing submissions for the tech challenge.

Follow the steps in this README to create a submission from the command line. Additionally, you can open your
favorite IDE and work from there.

### Requirements
- macOS or Linux terminal
- Java 8 or higher

### 1. Run the following command in the terminal to compile
```bash
javac TechChallenge.java
```

### 2. Run the program with:
```bash
java TechChallenge
```

This will read the "dataset.tsv" file from "data/" and output a "solution.tsv" which you can upload to the online score board.
